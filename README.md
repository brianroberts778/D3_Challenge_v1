# D3 for Data journalism

This project looks to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age, available in this dataset.

- Using D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 
- This graphic is coded in the app.js file of the directory. (Make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function.)
- State abbreviations are included in the circles.
- Axes and labels are created and situated to the left and bottom of the chart.

Note: python -m http.server is used to run the visualization. This hosts the page at localhost:8000 in a web browser.
